# Business case

- You as DM would like to use this tool to calculate the difficulty of an Encounter for your Party.
- You as DM can use pre-define your own Party of characters
  - E.g. 4 characters of level 2 (or a mix!)
    - consisting of different classes (you can use the API for this!)

# Business needs

- As a DM I want to be able to create a Party so that I can add them to an Encounter calculation.
- As a DM I want to have an overview of the Party so that I can use it for the Encounter calculations.
- As a DM I want to Choose monsters so that I can add them to an Encounter calculation.
- As a DM I want to save the Encounter I am working on so that I can continue later.
- As a DM I want to load the Encounter I have worked on so that I can continue with a previously saved Encounter.
- As a DM I want to know the difficulty score of an Encounter so that I know if the Party will survive the Encounter.
  - tip: you can use the included hook for this.
